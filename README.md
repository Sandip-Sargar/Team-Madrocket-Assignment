This project is a React-based student management app that uses Firebase for authentication and Firestore for storing student data. It features a login page for secure access, a students page with a table listing student details, and options to view, edit, delete, or add students via a modal form. Users can navigate between the students page and logout via a sidebar, and all changes are dynamically updated in Firestore. Styled with Material-UI, the app is ready for deployment on any hosting platform.
